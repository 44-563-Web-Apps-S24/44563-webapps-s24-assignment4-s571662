        <h6> THE THREE SISTERS ACT 4- ANTON  CHEKOV </h6>
        <P> SOLENI. The old man is unnecessarily excited. I won't go far, I'll only
            just bring him down like a snipe. [Takes out his scent-bottle and scents
            his hands] I've poured out a whole bottle of scent to-day and they still
            smell... of a dead body. [Pause] Yes.... You remember the poem
            
                "But he, the rebel seeks the storm,
                 As if the storm will bring him rest..."?
            
            CHEBUTIKIN. Yes.
            
                "He didn't have the time to sigh,
                 The bear sat on him heavily."
            
            [Exit with SOLENI.]
            
            [Shouts are heard. ANDREY and FERAPONT come in.]
            
            FERAPONT. Documents to sign....
            
            ANDREY. [Irritated]. Go away! Leave me! Please! [Goes away with the
            perambulator.]
            
            FERAPONT. That's what documents are for, to be signed. [Retires to back
            of stage.]
            
            [Enter IRINA, with TUZENBACH in a straw hat; KULIGIN walks across the
            stage, shouting "Co-ee, Masha, co-ee!"]
            
            TUZENBACH. He seems to be the only man in the town who is glad that the
            soldiers are going.
            
            IRINA. One can understand that. [Pause] The town will be empty.
            
            TUZENBACH. My dear, I shall return soon.
            
            IRINA. Where are you going?
            
            TUZENBACH. I must go into the town and then... see the others off.
            
            IRINA. It's not true... Nicolai, why are you so absentminded to-day?
            [Pause] What took place by the theatre yesterday?
            
            TUZENBACH. [Making a movement of impatience] In an hour's time I shall
            return and be with you again. [Kisses her hands] My darling... [Looking
            her closely in the face] it's five years now since I fell in love with
            you, and still I can't get used to it, and you seem to me to grow more
            and more beautiful. What lovely, wonderful hair! What eyes! I'm going to
            take you away to-morrow. We shall work, we shall be rich, my dreams will
            come true. You will be happy. There's only one thing, one thing only:
            you don't love me!
            
            IRINA. It isn't in my power! I shall be your wife, I shall be true to
            you, and obedient to you, but I can't love you. What can I do! [Cries] I
            have never been in love in my life. Oh, I used to think so much of love,
            I have been thinking about it for so long by day and by night, but
            my soul is like an expensive piano which is locked and the key lost.
            [Pause] You seem so unhappy.
            
            TUZENBACH. I didn't sleep at night. There is nothing in my life so awful
            as to be able to frighten me, only that lost key torments my soul and
            does not let me sleep. Say something to me [Pause] say something to
            me....
            
            IRINA. What can I say, what?
            
            TUZENBACH. Anything.
            
            IRINA. Don't! don't! [Pause.]
            
            TUZENBACH. It is curious how silly trivial little things, sometimes
            for no apparent reason, become significant. At first you laugh at these
            things, you think they are of no importance, you go on and you feel that
            you haven't got the strength to stop yourself. Oh don't let's talk about
            it! I am happy. It is as if for the first time in my life I see these
            firs, maples, beeches, and they all look at me inquisitively and wait.
            What beautiful trees and how beautiful, when one comes to think of it,
            life must be near them! [A shout of Co-ee! in the distance] It's time
            I went.... There's a tree which has dried up but it still sways in the
            breeze with the others. And so it seems to me that if I die, I shall
            still take part in life in one way or another. Good-bye, dear....
            [Kisses her hands] The papers which you gave me are on my table under
            the calendar.
            
            IRINA. I am coming with you.
            
            TUZENBACH. [Nervously] No, no! [He goes quickly and stops in the avenue]
            Irina!
            
            IRINA. What is it?
            
            TUZENBACH. [Not knowing what to say] I haven't had any coffee to-day.
            Tell them to make me some.... [He goes out quickly.]
            
            [IRINA stands deep in thought. Then she goes to the back of the stage
            and sits on a swing. ANDREY comes in with the perambulator and FERAPONT
            also appears.]
            
            FERAPONT. Andrey Sergeyevitch, it isn't as if the documents were mine,
            they are the government's. I didn't make them.
            
            ANDREY. Oh, what has become of my past and where is it? I used to be
            young, happy, clever, I used to be able to think and frame clever ideas,
            the present and the future seemed to me full of hope. Why do we, almost
            before we have begun to live, become dull, grey, uninteresting, lazy,
            apathetic, useless, unhappy.... This town has already been in existence
            for two hundred years and it has a hundred thousand inhabitants, not one
            of whom is in any way different from the others. There has never been,
            now or at any other time, a single leader of men, a single scholar, an
            artist, a man of even the slightest eminence who might arouse envy or a
            passionate desire to be imitated. They only eat, drink, sleep, and then
            they die... more people are born and also eat, drink, sleep, and so
            as not to go silly from boredom, they try to make life many-sided
            with their beastly backbiting, vodka, cards, and litigation. The wives
            deceive their husbands, and the husbands lie, and pretend they see
            nothing and hear nothing, and the evil influence irresistibly oppresses
            the children and the divine spark in them is extinguished, and they
            become just as pitiful corpses and just as much like one another as
            their fathers and mothers.... [Angrily to FERAPONT] What do you want?
            
            FERAPONT. What? Documents want signing.
            
            ANDREY. I'm tired of you.
            
            FERAPONT. [Handing him papers] The hall-porter from the law courts was
            saying just now that in the winter there were two hundred degrees of
            frost in Petersburg.
            
            ANDREY. The present is beastly, but when I think of the future, how good
            it is! I feel so light, so free; there is a light in the distance, I see
            freedom. I see myself and my children freeing ourselves from vanities,
            from kvass, from goose baked with cabbage, from after-dinner naps, from
            base idleness....
            
            FERAPONT. He was saying that two thousand people were frozen to death.
            The people were frightened, he said. In Petersburg or Moscow, I don't
            remember which.
            
            ANDREY. [Overcome by a tender emotion] My dear sisters, my beautiful
            sisters! [Crying] Masha, my sister....
            
            NATASHA. [At the window] Who's talking so loudly out here? Is that you,
            Andrey? You'll wake little Sophie. _Il ne faut pas faire du bruit, la
            Sophie est dormée deja. Vous êtes un ours._ [Angrily] If you want
            to talk, then give the perambulator and the baby to somebody else.</P>
