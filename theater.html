        <p> <h6 class="SOLENI">SOLENI.</h6> <p class="speech">The old man is unnecessarily excited. I won't go far, I'll only
            just bring him down like a snipe.</p> <p class="direction">[Takes out his scent-bottle and scents
            his hands]</p> <p class="speech">I've poured out a whole bottle of scent to-day and they still
            smell... of a dead body.</p> <p class="direction">[Pause]</p> Yes.... You remember the poem
            
            <p class="speech">"But he, the rebel seeks the storm,

            <p class="speech">He seems to be the only man in the town who is glad that the
            soldiers are going.</p>
            
            <p class="speech">I came to say good-bye....</p>

            her, Olga Sergeyevna... it's time... I'm late...</p>

            <p class="direction">[He kisses OLGA'S hand in evident emotion, then embraces MASHA once more
            and goes out quickly.]</p>

           <p><h6 class="IRINA">IRINA.</h6> <p class="speech">It isn't in my power! I shall be your wife, I shall be true to
            you, and obedient to you, but I can't love you. What can I do!</p> <p class="direction">[Cries]</p> I
            <p class="speech">have never been in love in my life. Oh, I used to think so much of love,
            I have been thinking about it for so long by day and by night, but
            my soul is like an expensive piano which is locked and the key lost.</p>
            <p class="direction">[Pause]</p> You seem so unhappy.</p>
            
            <p><h6 class="TUZENBACH">TUZENBACH.</h6> <p class="speech">I didn't sleep at night. There is nothing in my life so awful
            as to be able to frighten me, only that lost key torments my soul and
            does not let me sleep. Say something to me</p> <p class="direction">[Pause]</p> say something to

            <p><h6 class="TUZENBACH">TUZENBACH.</h6> <p class="speech">It is curious how silly trivial little things, sometimes
            for no apparent reason, become significant. At first you laugh at these
            things, you think they are of no importance, you go on and you feel that
            you haven't got the strength to stop yourself. Oh don't let's talk about
            it! I am happy. It is as if for the first time in my life I see these
            firs, maples, beeches, and they all look at me inquisitively and wait.
            What beautiful trees and how beautiful, when one comes to think of it,
            life must be near them!</p> <p class="direction">[A shout of Co-ee! in the distance]</p> <p class="speech">It's time
            I went.... There's a tree which has dried up but it still sways in the
            breeze with the others. And so it seems to me that if I die, I shall
            still take part in life in one way or another. Good-bye, dear....</p>
            <p class="direction">[Kisses her hands]</p> papers which you gave me are on my table under
